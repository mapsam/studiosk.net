I"è<p>Berkeley Open Kitchen is a simple &amp; clean renovation that transforms this central Berkeley bungalow.  S_SK opened up the space by removing the wall separating the dining/ living area and the original kitchen. By enlarging windows, adding a new direct connection to the backyard, and the addition of skylights brings more light to not only the new kitchen but to the entire main living space of the house.  Red birch custom cabinets are used in the built-in dining room buffet and wraps up to the top of the cabinets in the kitchen, separating yet tying together the dining area and the more functional kitchen work surfaces. Appliances are integrated into storage cabinets and provide a minimal background for the life of the space.</p>
