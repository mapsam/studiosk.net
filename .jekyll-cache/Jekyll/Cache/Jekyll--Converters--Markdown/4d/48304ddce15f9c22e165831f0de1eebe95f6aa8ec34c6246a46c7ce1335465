I"‹<p>The Peacock Pool House project set between the San Francisco Bay and Peacock Gap lagoon in Marin County, reconceives the typical underutilized suburban backyard landscape into an active and entertaining space for a large family. The addition of a pool, sundeck and small lawn allows for daytime play and relaxation. Remodeling of the deck and building an outdoor kitchen allows for large group outdoor dining and entertaining. The addition of a changing room with full bath and sun arbor over a lounge seating area completes the activation of this space into a day and night place to enjoy the temperate California weather and sun filled days.</p>
