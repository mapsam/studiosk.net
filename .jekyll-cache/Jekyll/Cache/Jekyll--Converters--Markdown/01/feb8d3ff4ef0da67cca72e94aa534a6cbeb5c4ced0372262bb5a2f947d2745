I"ÿ<p>Flagship Showroom and Service Center for the Tesla electric car company housed in a pair of upcycled buildings, merged to create a clean and gallery-like setting for the display and servicing of the cars.</p>

<p>The design disrupts the typical separation of showroom and service areas, merging both to make the process fully transparent to guests as well as passersby on Santa Monica Blvd. The traditional mechanic has now become the salesperson for the 21st century car â€“ clean, smart and efficient.</p>
