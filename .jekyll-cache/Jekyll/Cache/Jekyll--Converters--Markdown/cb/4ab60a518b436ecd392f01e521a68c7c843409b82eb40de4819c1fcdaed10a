I"z<p>A prototype for a prefabricated off the grid house.</p>

<p>Conceived as three distinct modular “pavilions” under one monolithic roof, the structure seeks to maximize solar position, openness to the outdoors and to provide privacy for inhabitants when desired.</p>

<p>The program is positioned against a “wall” structure to provide site privacy from the access side and a maximum amount of transparency and openings to the landscape.</p>

<p>To minimize impact on the earth, the house is built on a raised platform to avoid costly site excavation and preserve the existing landscape wherever future homes are located.</p>
