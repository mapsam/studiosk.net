I"‰<p>Valley Hi-North Laguna Library is a new 20,500 square foot library in Sacramento that pushes the envelopes of sustainability, earning a LEED Gold certification.  This emphasis on sustainability led the modern design of the building with the main walls of the library being thick thermal dampening concrete to minimize cooling &amp; heating use depending on the season. The Story Time area naturally ventilates hot interior air vertically through the top of the tower.  Through the use of skylights, deep sunscreens and northern clerestory windows, daylighting is maximized but regulated.  The library also has photo voltaic panels laminated to the standing seam metal roof and also harvests rainwater from the roof to the water retaining bioswales in the landscape.</p>

<p>The library expands on the traditional role of libraries by not only containing an expanded collection in an inspiring open light-filled space but also provides separate community event spaces, technology and learning centers, study rooms and generous space for teens and children.  Valley Hi-North Laguna library won a Design Excellence Award from the AIA San Francisco in 2011.</p>
