I"n<p>The West Berkeley House, which is located within the burgeoning West Berkeley design loop, was an unlivable 862 sq. ft. house that had been uninhabited for 7 years. Acting as architect and general contractor, studio_SK completed renovated the house from the studs and provided direct connection to outdoor yard with a 250 sq. ft. addition. The addition includes converting a previously small bedroom into a new master suite with a completely new full bath. As part of the addition and seismic upgrades, s_sk was able to renovate the previous small living room and kitchen into a modern open plan great room, with a dining area facing the new deck and landscaped yard. The detached garage was reconstructed to be an art studio space. Old growth timber from the main house roof framing was used to clad the inside of the new studio space giving it a uniqueness and warmth.</p>
