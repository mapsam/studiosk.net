I"¡<p>Andyâ€™s Candy Apothecary seeks to provide maximum product display for a growing gourmet and locally made candy and gift market in a dense and redeveloping urban core. The space is conceived to be flexible for future modification and for special events such as childrenâ€™s birthdays, chocolate tastings and seasonal displays. The owners see this store as a prototype for future stores and mobile candy carts.</p>
