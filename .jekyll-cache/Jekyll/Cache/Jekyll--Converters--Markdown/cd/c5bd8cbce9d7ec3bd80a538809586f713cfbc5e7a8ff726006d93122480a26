I"i<p>Located on the edge of the Malibu coastline, this complete remodel of an existing house attempts to capture the wild and dynamic nature of its site. With no house to the west, views and light to the south and west are maximized, while the design provides privacy and screening from the nearby Pacific Coast Highway. The adjacent beach is shaped such that water swirls under the house and at high tide one feels as though they are floating on the ocean.</p>

<p>The interiors of the house are modern and attune with its beach location and designed to capture light, views and the serenity of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
