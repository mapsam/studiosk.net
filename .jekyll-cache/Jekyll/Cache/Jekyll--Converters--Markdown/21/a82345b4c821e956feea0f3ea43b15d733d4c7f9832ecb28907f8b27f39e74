I"À<p>SSK designed twenty-one new homes, The Moderns on Eames Walk, in the heart of The Bridge District in West Sacramento.  They are built to connect city living to outdoor experiences in a range of designs from 1,500 to 2,500 sf.  As the 2nd phase, in an ongoing revitalization of a former industrial site adjacent to the Sacramento River, the 21 for sale homes are sited and planned as a dense, walkable, and generously landscaped neighborhood. The homes are laid out in 3 zones - city units built close to the street and urban realm, the villas set above sidewalk grade facing the river and downtown Sacramento and the garden units adjacent to a pedestrian greenway and forested communal courtyard.</p>
