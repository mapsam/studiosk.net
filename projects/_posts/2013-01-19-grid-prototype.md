A prototype for a prefabricated off the grid house. 

Conceived as three distinct modular “pavilions” under one monolithic roof, the structure seeks to maximize solar position, openness to the outdoors and to provide privacy for inhabitants when desired.

The program is positioned against a “wall” structure to provide site privacy from the access side and a maximum amount of transparency and openings to the landscape.

To minimize impact on the earth, the house is built on a raised platform to avoid costly site excavation and preserve the existing landscape wherever future homes are located.
