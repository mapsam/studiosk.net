Andy’s Candy Apothecary seeks to provide maximum product display for a growing gourmet and locally made candy and gift market in a dense and redeveloping urban core. The space is conceived to be flexible for future modification and for special events such as children’s birthdays, chocolate tastings and seasonal displays. The owners see this store as a prototype for future stores and mobile candy carts.
