s_sk in collaboration with [WORD](http://www.warrenoffice.com/) and [Groundworks Office](http://www.groundworksoffice.com/), competed for the commission of a new Guggenheim Museum in Helsinki, Finland. Growing out of the exploratory nature of Nordic modernism, the museum is seen as a public place for art in the northern light of Finland.

Conceived as two museums under one roof, curatorial possibilities are doubled and spaces for art are varied to accommodate art of widely divergent types â€“ from sculpture requiring maximum volume to dark spaces for video media. The roof and light modulating grid shell structure is constructed from locally sourced laminated wood allowing for large open column free spaces and a minimum of load bearing walls or columns. The outside shell of the building has varying apertures of white metal, modulating light for program spaces below.
